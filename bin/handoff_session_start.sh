# handoff_session_start.sh — SessionStart hook output.
#
# Cats <repo>/.claude/handoff_current.md so the new session starts with
# the previous session's snapshot in context. Two extras over the
# original one-liner:
#
#   1. If the curated Notes block in handoff_current.md is the unedited
#      placeholder (i.e. SessionEnd auto-wrote the snapshot but no model
#      was in the loop to fill in prose), also cat the most recent file
#      from .claude/handoff_history/. The previous session's curated
#      prose is more useful than git-state-only.
#   2. If handoff_history/ has any entries, append a one-line pointer
#      so the assistant knows older snapshots exist and can run
#      /handoff-more to pull them in.
#
# Env overrides (rare):
#   HANDOFF_SS_DISABLE_FALLBACK=1  — never auto-include the previous
#       handoff, even if current is placeholder-only.
#   HANDOFF_SS_DISABLE_RECOVER=1   — never emit the /handoff-recover
#       sentinel block. Use if the user does not have the
#       handoff-recover skill installed and wants the silent
#       fallback-only behavior.
