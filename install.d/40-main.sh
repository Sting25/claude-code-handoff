# on a truncated `curl | bash` stream the trap is never armed and the parse
# error keeps its nonzero exit (armed earlier, bash 3.2 reports rc=0 — see
# the note above cleanup() in 00-preamble.sh). Residual gap, accepted: a
# stream that truncates exactly at a statement boundary before this group
# still exits 0 having installed nothing — no trap arrangement can catch
# that; only checksum verification of the fetched script would.
